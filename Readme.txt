Catalyzed Molecule Replication in an Artificial Chemistry

An architecture for an artificial chemistry featuring continuous physics
and discrete reactions. 

To build:

UNIX: type 'make'
Windows: See Visual Studio files in replicator folder.

To test:

Replicator -cycles <reaction cycles>
    [-numReplicators <number of replicator molecules>]
    [-numCatalysts <number of catalysts>]
    [-numComponents <number of free components>]
    [-input <input file name> (for run continuation)]
    [-output <output file name> (to save run)]
    [-logfile <log file name>]
    [-display (graphics)]
    [-pause (start in pause mode)]
